# first-onnx
A basic implementation of ONNX using the microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased model.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) using the `microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased` model. The ONNX model is located in the `onnx/model.py` file, and we've also provided the exported classifier model in both `onnx/classifier.onnx` and `onnx/classifier_int8.onnx` formats.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

```bash
# install dependencies for running the model
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install accelerate -U
# run the model
python onnx/model.py
```

app made with vite react 

```bash
# install dependencies for running the app
cd app
npm install
# run the app
npm run dev
```
